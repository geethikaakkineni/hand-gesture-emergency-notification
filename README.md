# hand-gesture-emergency-notification
The Hand Gesture Emergency Notification System is a real-time gesture recognition project designed to enhance emergency response mechanisms. Leveraging MediaPipe and TensorFlow, this system detects specific hand gestures from a webcam feed and triggers an emergency notification when a predefined gesture, such as "help," is recognized.
